## 2. Test Data Generation
### A. Static Test Data

Static test data is used everywhere within the project to test the express application. The static test data is located within
either the test cases or is loaded from the test folders that hold HTML or text files with predetermined data. This static data
makes sure the application can perform the correct methods as the data within doesn't affect the method calls.

describe('app', function(){
  describe('.render(name, fn)', function(){
    it('should support absolute paths', function(done){
      var app = createApp();

      app.locals.user = { name: 'tobi' };

      app.render(path.join(__dirname, 'fixtures', 'user.tmpl'), function (err, str) {
        if (err) return done(err);
        assert.strictEqual(str, '<p>tobi</p>')
        done();
      })
    })
  })
})

This is an example where the name tobi is statically created within the test case. The test then retrieves the user.tmpl file to
render it. This file has static HTML that is verified against to make sure it was retrieved correctly.

describe('res', function(){
  describe('.get(field)', function(){
    it('should get the response header field', function (done) {
      var app = express();

      app.use(function (req, res) {
        res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/x-foo');
        res.send(res.get('Content-Type'));
      });

      request(app)
      .get('/')
      .expect(200, 'text/x-foo', done);
    })
  })
})

This is an example where the application uses only static data within the test case itself. It sets the content type to the static
data and then expects that static data to be returned after the request is made.

### B. Dynamic Test Data

Dynamic test data is not used within the application as the application is not a data driven application. The application is
a web server that is used to serve data and to render HTML files. It doesn't matter what data is being sent only that the data
is correctly sent and can be retrieved. There are a limited amount of ways that the system can be interacted with and each case
is tested with static data to make sure it operates correctly. The application is not concerned with user validation.
