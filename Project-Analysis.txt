Project Selected: Express
I. Introduction

This Analysis highlights two tests cases within the Express application. It goes into detail about what the test cases verify,
the steps taken in the test, and how the code transitions states to get to the expected state. This helps in understanding the
importance of tests in while giving experience to a well designed open-source project.

II. Test Case 1: res.get.js

A. Description
Provide a concise overview of what this test case is designed to verify or validate within the project.

This test case verifies that express can get a response header field along with its status.

B. Gherkin Syntax (if applicable)
If you choose to use Gherkin syntax, write the Gherkin scenario for this test case.

  Scenario: Get request is sent to the application
    Given the header is set to content type text/x-foo
    And the response returns the content type
    When the request is sent to the app
    Then getting the response should return status 200 with value of text/x-foo

C. Test Steps
Enumerate the sequence of steps or actions involved in the test case.

First the test sets up any imports that are needed for creating and mocking the application.
It then creates the express application.
It uses supertest to mock the request setting the content header and response value.
It then sends the request to the application.
Finally, it checks the response to see if it is the correct type and status.

D. Code Segments Under Test
Identify specific code segments or functions that are being tested in this case.

res.send(res.get('Content-Type'));

The test is testing the get request header field method. The snippet above is used to test get by retrieving the content type of the response.
It then gets the response by using a get request to check the correct response header field is returned. Below is the code being tested.

/**
 * Get value for header `field`.
 *
 * @param {String} field
 * @return {String}
 * @public
 */

res.get = function(field){
  return this.getHeader(field);
};

E. Initial State
Describe the initial state or conditions of the system or component before executing the test.

Before the test there are initial states for the express app and the request. They are set equal to the
imports needed to create the application and mock the request.

F. Transition
Explain the actions or events that trigger a change in the system's state.

The transition is when a get request is created for the application. This request sets the header type and then
for the response sends the content type header field. Using request mock object the get request is made to
retrieve the response header field.

G. Expected State
Clearly outline the expected state or outcome after the test steps have been completed.

The expected state is that the response should have a 200 status and the content should be 'text/x-foo'.



III. Test Case 2: res.status.js 'when code is 403'
A. Description
Provide a concise overview of the purpose of the second test case.

This test case verifies that express can set the status of a response to 403 and return the correct status when the request is sent.

B. Gherkin Syntax (if applicable)
If you choose to use Gherkin syntax, write the Gherkin scenario for this test case.

    Scenario: Set status to 403
        Given the status is set to 403
        And the response returns the status
        When the request is sent to the app
        Then getting the response should return status 403

C. Test Steps
Enumerate the sequence of steps or actions involved in this test case.

First the test sets up any imports that are needed for creating and mocking the application.
It then creates the express application.
It uses supertest to mock the request setting the status to 403 and ending the response
It then sends the request to the application.
Finally, it checks the response status to make sure it returned 403.

D. Code Segments Under Test
Identify specific code segments or functions that are being tested in this case.

app.use(function (req, res) {
          res.status(403).end()
        })

The above snippet is testing the res.status method. It sets the status to 403 and ends the response.
The test is checking to make sure the status is set to 403. Below is the code being tested.

res.status = function status(code) {
  if ((typeof code === 'string' || Math.floor(code) !== code) && code > 99 && code < 1000) {
    deprecate('res.status(' + JSON.stringify(code) + '): use res.status(' + Math.floor(code) + ') instead')
  }
  this.statusCode = code;
  return this;
};

// Enter code
E. Initial State
Describe the initial state or conditions of the system or component before executing the test.

Before the test there are initial states for the express app and the request. They are set equal to the
imports needed to create the application and mock the request.

F. Transition
Explain the actions or events that trigger a change in the system's state.

The application is created and the app is given a response that has a status of 403. The request is mocked using supertest
which retrieves the response status from the application.

G. Expected State
Clearly outline the expected state or outcome after the test steps have been completed.

The expected state is that the response of the application is 403.
